## üí° Why Test Your Passwords? (The Core Benefit)

**Wondering if your passwords are strong enough to withstand a real attack?** This educational tool is here to help! It provides a realistic simulation of **Brute-Force Attacks** so you can measure the **actual time** it would take for modern hardware (CPU, GPU, ASIC) to compromise your digital defenses.

In a world full of digital threats, the strongest defense starts with **self-assessment**. Use this simulator to:

* **Get a Reality Check:** Stop guessing! See the precise time estimate (in seconds, years, or decades) for your passwords to be cracked.
* **Learn the Security Ropes:** Witness how small changes‚Äîadding a symbol or increasing length‚Äîcan dramatically impact security.
* **Choose Your Risk Level:** Select between the **50% (Average Case)** or the **100% (Worst-Case Scenario)**.

## ‚ú® Available Versions & Execution

The project offers full flexibility, whether you prefer visual feedback or command-line efficiency:

| Version | Files | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** | `cracker_app.py` | Users who prefer a **visual interface**, complete with a live dashboard and progress bars. |
| **Command Line Interface (CLI)** | `cracker_cli.py` | Developers who need **speed, raw data**, and a live-updating attempts counter. |
| **Executable (EXE)** | `cracker_cli.exe / cracker_app.exe` | **Windows users who don't want to install Python.** |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run from Source Code (Python Source)

Ensure the project files (`core_logic.py`, `cracker_cli.py`, `cracker_app.py`) are together.

| Version | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **GUI** | `python cracker_app.py` |
| **CLI** | `python cracker_cli.py` |

### 2. Run the Executable (Windows EXE)

If you're using the ready-made executable (check the `dist` folder):

1.  Open Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell.
2.  Navigate to the executable's folder.
3.  Run it:
    ```bash
    .\cracker_cli.exe
    ```
