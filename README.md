#  Why Test Your Passwords? (The Core Benefit)
Wondering if your passwords are strong enough to withstand a real attack? This educational tool is here to help! It provides a realistic simulation of Brute-Force Attacks so you can measure the actual time it would take for modern hardware (CPU, GPU, ASIC) to compromise your digital defenses.

### In a world full of digital threats, the strongest defense starts with self-assessment. Use this simulator to:

### Get a Reality Check: Stop guessing! See the precise time estimate (in seconds, years, or decades) for your passwords to be cracked.

### Learn the Security Ropes: Witness how small changes‚Äîadding a symbol or increasing length‚Äîcan dramatically impact security, turning a vulnerable password into an uncrackable fortress.

Choose Your Risk Level: Select between the 
50%
 (Average Case) or the 
100%
 (Worst-Case Scenario) to tailor the time estimate to your specific security needs.

#  Available Versions & Execution
The project offers full flexibility, whether you prefer visual feedback or command-line efficiency:

### Version	Files	Key Features
### Graphical User Interface (GUI)	cracker_app.py	Users who prefer a visual interface, complete with a live dashboard and progress bars.
### Command Line Interface (CLI)	cracker_cli.py	Developers who need speed, raw data, and a live-updating attempts counter.
### Executable (EXE)	cracker_cli.exe / cracker_app.exe	Windows users who don't want to install Python.

#  Quick Start
### 1. Run from Source Code (Python Source)
### Ensure the project files (core_logic.py, cracker_cli.py, cracker_app.py) are together.

### Version	Command
### GUI	python cracker_app.py
### CLI	python cracker_cli.py


### 2. Run the Executable (Windows EXE)
### If you're using the ready-made executable (check the dist folder):

### Open Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell.

### Navigate to the executable's folder.

### Run it:

### Bash

### .\cracker_cli.exe
